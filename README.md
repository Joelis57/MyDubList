```

- `<lang>` is a lowercase language key (e.g., `english`, `french`, `spanish`, `german`, `italian`, `japanese`, `korean`, `mandarin`, `hebrew`, `hungarian`, `portuguese_br`, etc.).
- `<confidence>` can be `low` (≥1 source), `normal` (≥2 sources), `high` (≥3 sources) or `very-high` (≥4 sources).
